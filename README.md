# Java full-stack

## Status

This project does not work yet, not even close.

## Goal

Use Java for both the server and the client. The client in this case is a vanilla browser, with Java compiled to Javascript and/or WebAssembly. No Java Applets!

* Java version: 8 for client and common code, anything for server
* Server: Spring, I guess
* Client: TeaVM with Flavour
* Communication: json (type-safe) over websocket
* Build tool: `maven`
